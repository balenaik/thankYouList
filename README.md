Thank You List is an iOS application developed using Swift 3.0. This project is for writing every day diary specifically with what you felt thankful for. This app is not an actual diary, so this is easy for whom having trouble with writing diary everyday (including meüòÅ). You can just input 3 things which you felt thankful, every day.
